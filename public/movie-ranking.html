<h1>The Best Movies According to Andrea</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2> 

<hr/>

<h3>The Conjuring</h3>
<p>I had to sleep with the lights on after watching this for the first time. I love pretty much any movie by James Wan - especially the Insidious and Anabelle series. I can watch them over and over, and never get tired of them.</p>

<h3>The Serpent and the Rainbow</h3>
<p>Super Creepy Movie. I almost believe that this exists and I'm a skeptical agnostic. There are documentaries of voodoo rituals and people being turned into zombies or coming back from the dead. People believe in it so much that it makes me question my own logic. I try not to make enemies because of this movie - you never know what kind of person you are pissing off. 
<h3>Talk to Me</h3>
<p>There were a lot of holes and questions that were unanswered in this movie, but I loved that it showed how people today would probably come in contact with demons and how they would post the experience on social media. The plot was unexpected and not as predictable as other horror movies that I have seen.</p>
